This software release complements the SEG San Antonio 2019 technical abstract:
https://library.seg.org/doi/10.1190/segam2019-3216760.1

## Requirements

Current supported Julia version: 1.2

Package dependencies (type in Julia REPL):

'''
] add Optim
] add LineSearches
] add PyPlot
] add JLD2
] add ImageFiltering
'''

## Instructions

To run the Gaussian lens inversion problem:

### Generate synthetic data

From the parent directory, type in Julia REPL:
include("./data/Gausslens/gendata_Gausslens.jl")

This will create a file "./data/Gausslens/Gausslens_data.jld" containing domain discretization details, true squared slowness model, source/receiver geometry, and frequency-domain synthetic data.

The squared slowness model can be inspected by typing:
imshow(m', cmap = "jet", aspect="auto")

Data in source/receiver coordinates can be inspected by typing:
imshow(real.(dat[1])', aspect = "auto", cmap = "jet")

### Run the WRI dual inversion script

From the parent directory, type in Julia REPL:
include("./scripts/inversion_Gausslens.jl")

In order to run FWI on the same model, comment/uncomment the relevant lines in the script.
